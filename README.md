# This repository includes the codes and images that were generated for Image Processing and Generative AI Book by Manning Publications.
# Codes and images will be organized chapter by chapter 
# The layout of the chapter, the codes and images will be listed under each title:

3.4 Distortion: Ames Room
Figure 3.4.1 Ames Room downloaded from [11]
Figure 3.4.2. Ames Room illusion of three people at the same height
As we discussed an Ames room manipulates human perception to create an illusion of size and distance. Listing 3.4.1 shows basic two objects moving on a three 3d plane in a trapezoidal room. Generative AI can manipulate digital perception, creating new data that appears real. For example, a GAN can be trained to generate images that look like real photographs to human observers.
In a more direct application, generative AI can be used to create digital Ames rooms to create movie scenes like Willy Wonka and Lord of the Ring which used manual techniques to create the effect. A GAN could be trained on images of Ames rooms and then generate new ones.
